# = agentSubstitution.rb
#
# == Description
#
# This file contains all the types of substitutions that this agent can 
# perform on any commands received from the Experiment Controller.
#
# How substitution work:
# - when the agent receives a command wich contains a string of the form %key%
# - it subsitutes that string with another string dynamically built by that agent
#
# How does this agent recognise a 'key' to substitue and does the job?
# - for each 'key' there should be a method defined below with the same name
# - this defined method should have the necessary code to build the substitute string
#
# See the simple 'index' and 'hostname' examples below
#
# Note: in the methods below, the parameter 'controller' is a handle on the agent 
# itself, so that your own substitution method can access the agent's attributes and
# methods to build your own substitute string

module AgentSubstitutions

  # Substitute '%index%' with the unique index number that was assigned to this agent
  def AgentSubstitutions.index(controller)
    return controller.index
  end

  # Substitute '%hostname%' with the hostname of this agent as given by /bin/hostname
  def AgentSubstitutions.hostname(controller)
    return `/bin/hostname`.chomp
  end

  # FOR WINLAB...
  #
  # Substitute '%x%' by the X coordinate of this agent's node
  # Substitute '%y%' by the Y coordinate of this agent's node
  # Assumptions: 
  # - this agent's control interface has been set in its YAML config file
  # - the corresponding IP is of the form: AAA.BBB.x.y 
  # (e.g. 10.11.1.1 for node1-1 on interface eth1 on sandbox1 at WINLAB)
  def AgentSubstitutions.x(controller)
    return controller.controlIP.split('.')[2]
  end
  def AgentSubstitutions.y(controller)
    return controller.controlIP.split('.')[3]
  end
